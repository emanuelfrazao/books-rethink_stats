## on hypothesis and models

* one way to model a situation is to:
    * formulate an **hypothesis** about the situation: e.g., `evolution is netrual`
    * formulate a detailed **process model** of that hypothesis - the way in which the components act and interact: e.g., `neutral at equilibrium`
    * formulate a **statistical model** associated with that process model
* the key thing to note is that:
    * different **hypothesis** can correspond to the same **statistical model**
    * the same **hypothesis**, if associated with different **process models**, can correspond to different **statistical models**

## on the tools needed for model engineering

* the (interconnected) tools to be used in the book are:
    1. **bayesian data analysis**: following bayesian interpretation
    2. **model comparison**: cross-validation and information criteria
    3. **multilevel models**: arrise when one substitutes a parameter in a model by a model of its own - say, recursive composition
    4. **graphical causal models**: association engine - to design statistical models for the purpose of causal identification

## on multilevel models

* way nicer, more robust, and realistic than single-level models
* *multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression*
* fitting and interpretation is harder
